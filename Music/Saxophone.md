Named after the inventor, Adolphe Sax, the saxophone is the newest woodwind and does not appear in many old classical works, but it is important for jazz. It is played similar to the clarinet with a single reed, and many musicians play both instruments. These are always made from brass.

Saxophones come in at least six different sizes and transpose notes.
