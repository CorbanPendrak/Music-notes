Enjoying classical music, like any music, involves engagement. In general, music has become additional to other activities, like writing notes. Because of the more subtle nature of classical music, listening is best in silence and focus, like in the dark.

When listening to classical music:
* Focus on Melody
	* Differently than most popular music, classical music focuses on melody and rhythm instead of lyrics. These can evolve, split, and change dramatically.
* Decide emotion
	* Since the music seldom has lyrics or helpful names, it is important to determine the emotion of the piece. 
* Visualize
	* Try to imagine movement or scenes inspired by the music.
* Explore styles
	* While commonly combined, composers can have widely different styles; find your favorite and explore similar pieces. 
* Listen multiple times
	* Classical music takes time to enjoy, and some pieces should be listened to multiple times to enjoy different components.
