String instruments vibrate a tightly stretched string to create beautiful music. The major difference between the other orchestral string instruments is size and corresponding musical ranges. 

# Violin

The violin has played a prominent role in all orchestral music since the beginning of classical music, playing the majority of the [[Elements of Music#Melody|melody]]. The violin has 4 string fastened by pegs at the top and the tailpiece at the bottom. The strings are tuned with the pegs at the top or micro-screws at the bottom. 

Every violin uses the bow to produce the music. The bow stretches horse hair coated in rosin, a chalky powder. There are many bowing techniques to change the [[Elements of Music#Timbre|timbre]].

Creating excellent violins takes a lucky combination of materials, workmanship, varnish, baking, aging, and luck, making good violins staggeringly expensive. The best violins, created 300 years ago by the famous Stradivari and Guarneri, cost millions of dollars. They originally used catgut, sheep intestines, stretchable to different lengths, but players typically use metal strings to increase sound.

Interrupting a vibrating string halfway produces a note an octave higher than the original string. Placing your finger closer to the pegs creates notes closer to the original string. Multiple strings can be played simultaneously, but this is more difficult. Vibrato vibrates the [[Elements of Music#Melody|pitch]] slightly adding a unique sound. Pizzicato plucks the strings without the bow for a different sound. [This symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCck3ykaTQQ) is played entirely without bows.

# Viola

The viola is slightly larger than the violin, creating lower notes, but making it the most difficult string instrument to play. 

- Concertos for violas are rare, because they mainly accompany the violin, but here are a few

# Cello

The cello has a beautiful, rich sound. The cello is too big to be placed underneath the chin, but to large to play standing, like the double bass. Its lower range makes it play the lower notes.

# Double Bass

The double bass is very large and played standing up or on a very tall stool. There is no single bass, and bass means double bass.

- Works for bass solo are very rare, but interesting
	- [_Double Bass Concerto in E major_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNYuRbsSJYw)

	- [_Pulcinella Suite_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4KYuhfag5I)

# Harp

The harp has 47 strings and must be tuned before each rehearsal and performance. The strings are color coded with C as red and F as blue, using distance to find the others. 7 pedals, for each of the notes, with three positions to change the pitch of each note.

Glissando on the harp is where the harpist runs their fingers along the strings to make a rushing scale. It is dramatically beautiful, but it tends to be overused, especially by movie music composers.

# Classical Guitar

The classical guitar is the most favored classical music instrument by non-classical-music people. The classical guitar has six strings and frets to play exact notes and multiple notes at the same time.
