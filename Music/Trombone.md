The trombone is a common parade instrument. The basic design has changed little in 500 years, called the _Sackbut_ in the Renaissance. Unlike the other brass instruments, it has a slide. 

There are seven slide positions, with variations according to lip tightness. A glissando, sliding sound, comes from sliding between the positions.
