The basic organizational principles express ideas in music.

# Rhythm

Rhythm is the orderly flow of music through time, including beats, meter, and tempo, even when it is not catchy and memorable.

The **beat** is a regular pulse dividing the time into equal units, either strongly or vaguely sensed. Pop music is typically more recognizable, while Classical music hides it more. **Meter** is a group of beats with different stress, with **duple meter** in two beats, and **triple meter** in three beat. **Tempo** is the speed of the beats, indicated with a **metronome**, which indicates beats with ticking, or words, usually Italian, providing general descriptions that can vary according to performer.

| Word        | Meaning                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Largo       | Very slow, broad                |
| Adagio      | Slow, leisurely                 |
| Grave       | Very slow, heavy                |
| Andante     | "Walking" speed, moderate       |
| Moderato    | Moderate                        |
| Allegro     | Moderately fast, moving briskly |
| Vivace      | Lively                          |
| Presto      | Very fast                       |
| Prestissimo | As fast as possible             |

The benefits of written music notation are specific composer instructions and preserve the art, decreasing the importance of the performer, but it limits music by quantifying sounds and general planning improvisation. 

Attendees at classical music concert are supposed to be quiet, for the audience to check the performer's work. Symphonies are much more structured and able to be repeated, but the audience sits without emotion. 

A rest represents the absence of sound.

# Melody

**Pitch** is the highness of lowness of a sound, resulting from the vibrations per second with more vibrations creating higher pitches. **Melody** is when the pitches are arranged logically, like a sentences, and generally the memorable part of the music. Melody typically appears in the high range because of the easier perception.

In northern Italy, music notation was greatly influenced by the grid of lines defining the pitch. An octave is the higher string vibrating at twice the lower string, and every musical culture uses octave duplication, with variations in division. 6 scale is used by India. Penatonic (5) scale is used in many eastern cultures. Seven note scale in west from Greeks, but twelve equal-in-size pitches are in the octave. 

The major system is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. The minor system is whole-half-whole-whole-half-whole-whole. This uses the black keys, but with the difference between b-c and e-f is a half step. Major is typically happier than minor, but only due to cultural influences.

# Dynamics

**Dynamics** is the levels of loudness of the music, sometimes mistakenly identified as volume.

| Term        | Symbol | Meaning         |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Fortissimo  | ff     | Very loud       |
| Forte       | f      | Loud            |
| Mezzo Forte | mf     | Moderately loud |
| Mezzo Piano | mp     | Moderately soft |
| Piano       | p      | soft            |
| Pianissimo  | pp     | very soft       |
# Timbre

**Timbre**, or color, is everything except a sound's pitch, loudness, or length, because an instrumental note is a complex wave of multiple frequencies. Variations in different instruments is the timbre, and variation in specific instruments, players, or pieces is the tone or tone quality. These are no direct definitions of timbre descriptions, but some words include reedy, brassy, clear, focused, breathy, rounded, piercing, strident, harsh, warm, mellow, resonant, dark, heavy, or flat.

# Harmony

Western music has multiple sounds at once with chords.

1. According to Professor Wright, what are the two things that really distinguish the music of western civilization from that of other cultures?

1. What is it in music that helps set up the harmony?

# Texture

**Texture** is how strands of music are put together. Melody without accompanying sounds is **monophonic**, while accompaniment, usually chords, is **homophonic**. Multiple music strands creates **polyphonic** texture. 

**Form** is the arrangement of musical events emphasizing shape with important sonic events.
