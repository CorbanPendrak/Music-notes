This horn has a powerful, elegant, full, round, dark tone. The French Horn is an actual horn, unlike the British Horn.

The natural horn was a coil of brass tubing with a mouthpiece and a bell shaped opening without valves or keys. With this, it is possible to play 16 notes with different lip tightness and different 16 notes with tubing extensions.  

The modern horn uses rotary valves adjust tubing length for pitch while still requiring consistent, precise lip tightness.
