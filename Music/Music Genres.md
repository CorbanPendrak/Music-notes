Music is a large subject, and there are several ways to divide the subject. 

# Western Music

Western music is the most popular style of music, involving standards of tuning, melody, harmony, rhythm, notation, form and other basic rules established at the end of the Middle Ages. As a generalization, western music is generally **tonal**, in an easy to recognize beat, with straightforward rhythms, strict harmony rules, and little improvisation. Twentieth century music particularly tried breaking the rules, but incredible flexibility allows for their common acceptance today as the **common practice** of music.

Nonwestern music grew from different cultural traditions than European, generally exotic compared to Western music, with different tuning systems, scales, vocal styles, performance practices, melody, and harmony rules.

# Jazz Music

Much music is a combination of different types of [[Music Genres#Western Music|Western]] and nonwestern music. Jazz and the blues are a combination of European and African, Latin, and Caribbean traditions.

# World Music

World music is the general category for music with widespread popularity unlike North American popular music. This includes older blended traditions and newer established genres, but typically not folk or traditional music. Since African-American traditions are common in popular music, they are not included, but Native American and Cajun traditions are.

# Classical Music

In visual arts, classical refers to ancient Greece and Rome. Since ancient music is mostly unavailable, classical music, spanning the time from the 1700s to the present, is influenced by the ideals of classical art.

# Folk & Popular Music

Folk music is passed down generationally, often with recording. It can gradually change with multiple versions. Popular music has largely replaced folk music as the common music and is written recently and changes quickly, even the styles.
