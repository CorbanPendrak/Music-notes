The oboe has a reed to blow into instead of across, like the [[Flute|flute]]. A major part of being an oboe player is creating reeds from cane stalk, which can vary according to the individual and occasion, and are inserted moist into the oboe to play.

Along with the [[Trumpet|trumpet]], the oboe is one of the most difficult instruments to play. Played by a beginner, it sounds like an unhappy nasal duck, while and expert can make it sound clear, vibrant, and sweet.
