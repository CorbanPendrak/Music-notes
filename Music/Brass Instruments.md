The brass instruments produce some of the strongest sustained non-electric sounds. Brass instruments are made to play loudly and the lag from coiled tubing makes them sound late when played on time. Members of this group include the [[French Horn]], [[Trumpet]], [[Trombone]], and [[Tuba]].

Brass instruments produce tone with metal mouthpieces, depending on the player, with different lip vibrations for tone. Brass instruments are not because they are made of brass, thus the [[Saxophone]] is a [[Woodwind Instruments|woodwind instrument]].

Tonguing is articulating the notes in a piece of music instead of slurring them together. This involves tapping the tongue while buzzing the lips.

Mutes in an instrument's bell change the sound and can vary.

Brass instruments are very durable and can even be cleaned in an electric dishwasher.
