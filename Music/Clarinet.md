The clarinet looks similar to the [[Oboe|oboe]], but without the edge due to the double reed. With only a single reed and less temperamental, clarinet reeds can be easily bought instead of created by the musician. 

Clarinets are transposing instruments, so they play a lower note than pressed, so sheet music is intentionally higher.
